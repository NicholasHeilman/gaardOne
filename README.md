# Gaard One
Gaard One is a company that sells innovative and modular products for outdoor activities such as hunting and hiking.  Being very passionate about these things, and wishing for future generations to have the same opportunity to participate in these activities, Gaard One recognized the need for access to public land, and has made it their mission to buy one square foot of land for conservation for every dollar spent on their products.  

The goal of this project is to allow customers to directly see the impact their purchase has on furthering conservation efforts.  A user with administrative permissions will be able to print QR codes to attach to product tags, which the customer will then be able to scan to view a parcel of land effectively purchased by them for conservation.
